        <h1>Hello World</h1>
        <p>
            <p1>The actual content inside is 200px wide.
         The text is padded by 20px left and right, and 10px top and bottom.
         It has a dotted border 2px thick.</p1>

    

            <p2>This box has the same exact CSS styles applied to it,
              the distance between the two boxes is 30px.
               Overlap between margin is a thing.</p2>
